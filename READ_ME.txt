Purpose
=======
This suite of files is intended to illustrate issues addressed by the MISRA C rules as expressed in:

   MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems,
      ISBN 978-1-906400-10-1 paperback and ISBN 978-1-906400-11-8 PDF.

The examples are mainly taken from the example sections in the MISRA C:2012 guidelines. It is not intended to be an exhaustive test suite and should not be used as such.

Implementation
==============
One (or more) files exist for each guideline within the suite. Where no examples are appropriate, the file will state that no example is provided for that guideline.

The file "R_xx_yy.c" illustrates MISRA C:2012, rule xx.yy. For example, R_20_04.c illustrates Rule 20.4 and D_04_05.c illustrates Directive 4.5.

The guidelines that are marked with "System" analysis scope are designed to be analysed across translation units and so may not produce an appropriate violation if run as a single file. To aid analysis there are two additional files for each section in the guidelines. For example R_08_system.c contains a "main" function that calls the external functions for rules in section 8. R_08_support.c is a second call to those functions and exists to minmize the number of Rule 8.7. violations.


Version Control
===============
Each version of the exemplar suite is released in a single ZIP file. An MD5 checksum is provided for each Released ZIP file. Each file within a release will contain a record of the Last Modified Date for that file. To ensure that you have a valid copy of the latest release, please download from the MISRA website.

Limitations 
===========
The examples have been written assuming 32-bit integer word size, i.e. char is 8-bit, short is 16-bit, int is 32-bit and long is 64-bit. If this is used on a 16-bit integer machine, additional issues may be reported.

Results
=======
Files contain a number of C language statements. These are: 
a) support statements,
b) "Compliant" examples,
c) "Non-compliant" examples.
 
A "Compliant" example is a construct that should not generate a warning message.
A "Non-compliant" example is a construct that should generate a warning message. The exact location of this warning is permitted to be tool dependent.

It is not always possible to avoid cross-talk between rules, so some files will violate multiple rules. In particular, no attempt has been made to provide definitions for all external functions or objects (R.8.6), nor is there always more than one use of such identifiers (R.8.7). 

Tools may also generate additional messages. 

Feedback
========
Feedback may be provided via the MISRA C Forum.
